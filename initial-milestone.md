# Initial Milestone

## Task-1: Investigate the different data types used in FLINT stimulations. 
Currently, there are five main data types for the FLINT inputs: JSON, CSV, SQL DB, GeoTIFF, Shapefiles. They can be found inside the [Standalone_GCBM/layer](https://github.com/moja-global/GCBM.Belize/tree/master/Standalone_GCBM/layers) and [Standalone_GCBM/input_database](https://github.com/moja-global/GCBM.Belize/tree/master/Standalone_GCBM/input_database).
 
1. Install required libraries/dependencies to open the files in a python notebook.
2. Test the code for each data-type, look for various data and store them a in a JSON.
3. Write markdown cells to describe the datatype, the tools/installation we need along with the links and a short discription of what the code does.
4. Publish the .ipynb files on Github.
5. Discuss and work with .[Namya](https://github.com/Namyalg) to document the different data types in moja global docs.

## Task - 2: Create Flask endpoints
   Work on developing Flask endpoints to index and pre-process the data by understanding how the input data is used in the GCBM. 
   This also includes building components in the FLINT-UI to view and modify the input metadata.
   
## Task - 3: Extend help to FLINT-UI
   I'm currently new to vue.js so I'll also be taking up beginner-friendly issues in the UI project for the initial weeks so I don't face any difficulties while working on bigger things in the coming weeks. For that reason, I shall be working along my co-mentee [Soham](https://github.com/sohamsshah) to help with his work. I'm currently working on to build a footer. The issue can be found [here](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT-UI/issues/116)
