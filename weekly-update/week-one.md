# Week-One

## Task-1: Investigate the different data types used in FLINT stimulations. 
 Currently, there are five main data types for the FLINT inputs: JSON, CSV, SQL DB, GeoTIFF, Shapefiles. They can be found inside the [Standalone_GCBM/layer](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/releases) and [Standalone_GCBM/input_database](https://github.com/moja-global/GCBM.Belize/tree/master/Standalone_GCBM/input_database).
 
1. Install required libraries/dependencies to open the files in a python notebook.
2. Test the code for each data-type, look for various data and store them a in a JSON.
3. Write markdown cells to describe the datatype, the tools/installation we need along with the links and a short discription of what the code does.
4. Publish the .ipynb files on Github.

## Task-2: Create a footer componenet for FLINT-UI.

1. I had previously self-assigned this [issue](https://github.com/moja-global/FLINT-UI/issues/116).
